                    <p>Triple axel is a jump, after a forward-facing takeoff, that involves three and a half rotations.
                        (The axel is the only jump in which skaters leave the ice facing forward.)This is also a jump
                        that Yuzuru Hanyu never fails.</p>

                    <p>The Biellmann spin is executed by the skater grabbing their free blade and pulling the heel of their boot behind and above the level
                        of the head so that their legs are in an approximate full split, with the head and back arched
                        upward.</p>

                <p>A Doughnut spin is a varaiation of a camel spin where the skater grabs their skate from behind, the
                    skater's head is pulled toward the free leg's foot so that the skater's head, torso, and free leg
                    form a doughnut shape parallel to the ice. In other words, looking dwon on the shater the leg and
                    torso form a circle or donought. </p>

                <p>A hydroblade is a figure skating edge move in which a skater glides on a deep edge
                    with the body stretched in a very low position, almost touching the ice, with the knee of the skating leg deeply bent, the free leg
                    crossed behind and extended outside the circle, and the upper body leaning into the circle with two,
                    one, or no hands skimming the ice.</p>

                <p>An Ina Bauer is a "moves in the field" element in figure skating in which a skater skates on two
                    parallel blades. One foot is on a forward edge and the other leg is on a backwards and different
                    parallel edge. The forward leg is bent slightly and the trailing leg is straight. </p>

                    usually behind.Starts in T-position and gradually presses forward, bending the skating knee and

                <p>A Y-spiral is performed with the skate of the free leg held out to the side. This is usually
                    performed as a catch-foot spiral, although some skaters have increased the difficulty of this
                    position by releasing the foot and holding the leg position unsupported.</p>
